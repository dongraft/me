    <hr>
    <p>I am a highly skilled software engineer with 10+ years of experience, currently based in Ciudad de México, seeking a remote position in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>I have extensive experience working with startups and building strong backend teams from scratch.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I have gained proficiency in a variety of programming languages and tools, working mainly on Python and the framework Django and the different technologies behind them, such as Postgresql, AWS and Docker.</p>
    <p>At Cornershop, I played a key role in defining team responsibilities, project scopes, and headcounts, while also mentoring and leading my team members. I am familiar with agile software development practices and remote team management, and am always striving to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas. I am committed to writing high-quality code and fostering a healthy, productive team environment, and have a proven track record of delivering results.</p>
    <p>I have always been passionate about how (and why) things work. The need to understand the ways of the world. I have a fixer brain. I like to make sure that given a specific problem, we can find the best solution and implement it. </p>
    <p>On a personal note, I have listened to music for as long as I remember, making me a big music fan, collector (in many forms, digital and physical) and a concert photographer.</p>
