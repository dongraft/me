    <p>Engineering Manager and Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience leading teams, building scalable systems, and delivering impactful solutions. Based in Ciudad de México, I thrive in remote work environments and am passionate about contributing to impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>I have extensive experience working with startups and building strong backend teams from scratch.</p>
    <p>At Nu, I manage a team of engineers, guiding their careers and driving team rituals to ensure successful project delivery. At Examedi, I advanced from a software engineer to leading a team of 10, driving initiatives like improved doctor scheduling, payment integrations, and team mentorship. Previously, during my eight years at Cornershop, I played a pivotal role in scaling engineering teams and implementing critical systems for payments, customer service, catalog management, and inventory. My leadership and technical expertise directly contributed to the company’s rapid growth and operational success.</p>
    <p>With a strong foundation in Python, Django, Postgresql, AWS, and Docker, I excel at solving complex problems and fostering collaborative team environments.</p>
    <p>On a personal note, I have listened to music for as long as I remember, making me a big music fan, collector (in many forms, digital and physical), and a concert photographer.</p>
