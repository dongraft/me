    <p>Engineering Manager and Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience leading teams, building scalable systems, and delivering impactful solutions. I thrive in remote work environments and am passionate about contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>I have extensive experience working with startups and building robust backend teams from the ground up.</p>
    <p>At Nu, I managed a team of five engineers, guiding their careers and driving team rituals to ensure successful project delivery of the member get member initiative from the Growth team. At Examedi, I advanced from a software engineer to leading a team of 10, driving initiatives like improved doctor scheduling, payment integrations, and team mentorship. Previously, during my eight years at Cornershop, I played a pivotal role in scaling engineering teams and implementing critical systems for payments, customer service, catalog management, and inventory. My leadership and technical expertise directly contributed to the company’s rapid growth and operational success.</p>
    <p>I excel at solving complex problems and fostering collaborative team environments.</p>
