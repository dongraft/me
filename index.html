    <p>Engineering Manager with over 10 years of experience leading high-performing teams, scaling backend systems, and delivering impactful products across fintech, healthtech, and marketplace platforms.</p>

    <p>I specialize in building engineering cultures that balance velocity with quality—driving growth through strong team rituals, mentorship, and close collaboration with product, design, and data.</p>

    <p>At Nu, I managed a team of five engineers and led the delivery of the Member Get Member initiative within the Growth team. At Examedi, I grew from Senior Engineer to Engineering Manager, leading a team of 10 and driving improvements in scheduling, payments, and engineering practices. Previously, I spent eight years at Cornershop (LatAm's Instacart), where I helped scale engineering efforts across critical systems such as payments, customer service, and inventory.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about developing people, fostering autonomy, and helping teams deliver meaningful, reliable software.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I'm a lifelong music enthusiast, a collector of both digital and physical formats, and a dedicated photographer.</p>
